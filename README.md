This is a gulp project, to generate presentation files:
`$gulp dist`  
copy files from the 'dist/' directory

You will need to run a local server for these files

on a mac, cd into the dist folder, and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

allow python to accept incoming requests

open your browser and go to `localhost:8080`
